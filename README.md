# Stocktwits Sentiment Classification
This repository contains the code I wrote as part of a group project at Stanford's machine learning class (CS 129) in the winter quarter of the 2023-2024 academic year.
It classifies Stocktwits messages into either positive, neutral, negative, or spam using BERT.
Stocktwits is a social media platform similar to X (formerly Twitter) that focuses on discussing stocks and is widely used by the retail investor community.

stocktwits_scrape.ipynb scrapes Stocktwits messages using classes and functions defined in the src folder (parser.py, scraper.py, utils.py) given the list of tickers (microcap.csv).
For each ticker, I retrieve the most recent 100 messages on Stocktwits that tag the ticker, which resulted in around 80,000 messages (stocktwits_scraped.csv).
2,200 messages were randomly selected, manually labelled (labelled_bert.csv), and used to fine-tune the BERT model in bert_clean.ipynb with a 5:2.5:2.5 split for train/validation/test sets.

The trained BERT model had 81.4% accuracy, 66.7% preicision, and 65.4% recall on the test set.
The macro one-versus-rest AUC score was 0.886.
The model was then used to classify the remaining messages (lablled_full_bert.csv), which were then used for subsequent parts of the group project.
